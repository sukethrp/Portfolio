          <p className="text-white/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            My academic journey began at Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, where I developed a strong foundation in computer science. I've worked on various projects including Alzheimer's disease classification using RF signals and machine learning, and a music recommendation system using Python and Last.FM API.
